        Example 1: Descriptive paragraph

        The old man sat in his rocking chair, his eyes closed and his head bowed. His wrinkled skin was pale and leathery, and his hair was thin and white. He wore a faded blue shirt and brown overalls, and his feet were bare. A worn Bible lay open in his lap, and a pair of glasses rested on the page.
        
        Example 2: Narrative paragraph
        
        I woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside my window. The sun was shining brightly, and the air was crisp and cool. I got out of bed and threw on my clothes, eager to start my day. I made myself a cup of coffee and sat down at my desk to write.
        
        Example 3: Expository paragraph
        
        The human body is a complex machine. It is made up of trillions of cells, which are the basic units of life. Cells work together to form tissues, organs, and systems. The human body has four major systems: the circulatory system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, and the nervous system.
